# MCRefreshView

MCRefreshView is a pull to refresh and load more view by Swift 2.0, Copy from MJRefresh: MJRefreshNormalHeader and MJRefreshBackNormalFooter. I had use in my project. And I had add the horizontal refresh view.
MCRefreshView has been updated swift 3
Compared with PSREFRESH / HTPULLREFRESH MCRefreshView is more suit for me
